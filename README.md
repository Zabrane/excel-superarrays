# excel-superarrays
A proof-of-concept for giving Excel/VBA supercharged array processing.

Array languages are awesome. People should be aware of what they're [missing out on](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok/blob/gh-pages/docs/Programming.md).

This repo offers proof-of-concept implementations of some array programming primitives that are missing from Excel/VBA. The motive is more to evangelise than to provide production-ready tools ('cause they're not).
